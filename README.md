# Computer Science Project Overview

Demystifying hard topics that seem scary an intimidating. Fighting!(in korean).
This repository is a comprehensive collection of various domains in computer science, aimed at providing hands-on learning, practical examples, and technical exercises in fields such as Blockchain, Cryptography, Ethical Hacking, Networking, and more. Each section focuses on a distinct subject area, providing scripts, configuration files, and resources to deepen understanding and application of fundamental computer science concepts.

## Blockchain

This section focuses on Blockchain technology, specifically around Bitcoin. It contains:

- `bitcoin_demo.py`: A Python implementation demonstrating the Bitcoin protocol, blockchain concepts, or transaction handling.
- `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`: Dependency management for Python, ensuring the correct libraries are installed for blockchain-related scripts.

## Cerebro

Cerebro contains tools and scripts for system automation, security, and infrastructure management, including:

- **Ansible**: Automation scripts like `update.yml` to manage system updates.
- **PKI**: Scripts for managing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates (`distribute.py`).
- **Firewall**: A script (`run.sh`) to configure and manage firewall rules, enhancing system security.

## Cryptography

This section contains a variety of cryptography-related materials:

- `sha256.py`: Demonstrates the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
- `rsa_blind_signature.py`: Implements RSA blind signatures, used for cryptographic privacy in digital signatures.
- **Images**: Resources and documentation (`exif.md`) related to extracting EXIF data from images, along with sample images.
- **Convergent Cryptography**: Documentation (`convergent.md`) on convergent encryption concepts.

## Ethical Hacking

This section covers essential tools and scripts for penetration testing and ethical hacking:

- `check_sys.sh`: A shell script to check the system's status, potentially checking for security vulnerabilities.
- **Tools Documentation**: Detailed markdown files on tools like Aircrack-ng (`aircrack.md`, `airodump.md`), used for auditing wireless network security.

## FRI/DF (Digital Forensics)

A section dedicated to digital forensics, with materials like:

- **Exercises**: Forensics exercises, including `furry.iso`, which could be used for disk analysis or file recovery.

## High-Performance Computing (HPC)

Contains exercises and examples related to parallel computing:

- Example scripts and test data to simulate high-performance computing tasks, such as `test_image.jpg` in an HPC context.

## Networking

A rich collection of networking concepts and practical examples, including:

- **VPN**: Documentation on VPN technologies (`vpn.md`) and various traffic captures (`IPsecVPNup.pcapng`) for analyzing VPN connections.
- **SSH**: Tutorials on SSH port forwarding (`ssh_port_forwarding.md`) and common password lists for brute force attacks (`common_passwords.txt`).
- **Network Tools**: Markdown files on tools like `nmap.md` and various network configurations (`netplan.md`).
- **RADIUS Authentication**: An example on setting up and analyzing RADIUS authentication (`radius.md`), including captured traffic (`RADIUSauth.pcapng`).
